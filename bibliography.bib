  abstract = {We introduce LEMMA2Jolie, a tool for translating domain models of microservice architectures given in LEMMA into concrete APIs of microservices in the Jolie programming language. Our tool combines the state of the art for the design and implementation of microservices: developers can use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for the construction of the domain models of a microservice architecture, and then automatically transition to a service-oriented programming language that provides native linguistic support for implementing the behaviour of each microservice.},
