                of microservice architectures given in LEMMA into concrete APIs
                of microservices in the Jolie programming language. Our tool
                combines the state of the art for the design and implementation
                of microservices: developers can use Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
                for the construction of the domain models of a microservice
                architecture, and then automatically transition to a
                service-oriented programming language that provides native
                linguistic support for implementing the behaviour of each
                microservice.},
